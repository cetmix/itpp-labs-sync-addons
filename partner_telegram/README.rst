# Telegram Contact Field

.. image:: static/description/icon.png

This module adds telegram fields to the partner form: `<models/res_partner.py>`__.

It works similarly to the `email` widget and opens the Telegram app when clicking the Telegram icon.

The Telegram value can be either a username or a mobile phone number prefixed with `+`.

An additional field, `telegram_ID`, is used for technical purposes and doesn't affect the partner form.
